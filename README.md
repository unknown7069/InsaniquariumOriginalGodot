# InsaniquariumOriginalGodot
A fan project to recreate Insaniquarium in Godot. 

# Background
During Christmas holidays 2020, it was the midst of covid and unlike most holidays, this year was destined to be dull. Along one of our long walks around the wintery neighborhood, my mind drifted to a game I had spent countless hours playing: Insaniquarium. As a kid, I always dreamed of a sequel, thinking of the various pets and fish and aliens that it could contain. But as the years went on, no sequel came and it was left to my imagination. 

Getting home from the walk I searched to see if any fan remakes had been made, but found nothing (beyond rip-off phone apps). Surely this was something that needed to be made! Feeling inspired, I would spend the rest of the break working on a remake of my own. I quickly lost motivation to work on the project - it was going to be massivly more difficult than I hoped. I'm uploading it as-is years later in the hopes that someone can make use of it. It's rough around the edges, escpeically on the art side of things, but has a solid foundation for building out more features.

# Screenshots
